```
Week 5 project to build a simple thermostat.

I test drove the development of the thermostat using the testing framework Jasmine.
The interactive aspect of the app was created with JavaScript and jQuery.

```

```
As a parent,
So I can check my thermostat is working,
I want my thermostat to start at 20 degrees celsius

As a parent,
So my child can be comfortable in their room,
I want to be able to increase and decrease the temperature 

As a parent,
So I can make sure my home doesn't get too cold,
I want to ensure that the temperature doesn't fall below 10 degrees celsius

As a parent,
So I can make sure that my home doesn't get too hot,
I want to ensure that the temperature doesn't rise above 32 degrees celsius

As a parent,
So I can monitor my family's energy usage,
I want the maximum temp to rise to only 25 degrees celsius when PSM (Power Saving Mode) is on

As a parent,
So I can be mindful of the environment,
I want to ensure that PSM (Power Saving Mode) is on by default
